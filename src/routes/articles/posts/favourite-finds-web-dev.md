A short list and overview of the favourite things I have found on the Internet for making web/software development tasks easier. I've also included some things that are nice for data science üßÆ 
<!-- more -->

> Work smarter not harder üòã

I've compiled this list with things that are just downright excellent at saving time. Time is short and no one should ever spend anytime looking to reinvent the wheel when putting a project together. Anything that I have come across online that is useful and increases my effeciency/output I've probably listed here. 

Keep in mind - this is not exactly every tool I use, but should be some of the more obscure finds in my time. ‚úå


Right now Ive got this list categorised as the following: 
- [Web Dev](#Web)
- [Dev](#Dev)
- [Data Science](#Data)

# <a name="Web"></a>Web Development Utilities

## Icons and Aethestics 

### SVG Box
A great online utility/API for a bevy of SVG based icons and emojis. The service has many different types of icons inluding file types, patterns, company logos and loading animations.

Alongside this and another great resource is the tabler-icons with the web utility [tablericons](https://www.tablericons.com)

### [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.dev/) and [HeroPatterns](https://www.heropatterns.com/)
Following on from SVGBox and Tablericons, another SVG icon service, HeroIcons has a great selection. However, here I want to draw more attention to the HeroPatterns utility which is great for adding a bit of spice to an app.

### [Wave](https://getwaves.io/) and [Blob Maker](https://www.blobmaker.app/)
For adding some splashes of colour to websites the wave and blob maker utilities provide a simple and quick way to do so. Change colour and parameters to achieve a look that fits what you are looking for.

### [Coolers](https://coolors.co/)
Just about got to be the best color palette designer on the web. The colour selection tool is excellent and allows the quick and easy creation of a colour scheme for any project.

## Design 

### [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
At this point I don't think many people are unaware of Figma, it is a top tier tool that comes packed with a bevy of features in the free tier. For the majority of design mockups it really has you covered, the intuitive interface is also much less daunting than a more fully-featured desktop program like XD or the like. Shoutout to [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) here too, not quite exactly the same in terms of UI/UX - but an excellent online design tool with a ton of templates to create basically anything in the shortest amount of time.

### [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)
If you need 80% of Photoshop, but don't want Photoshop - this should be your go-to. Photopea fills my the niche of photo editing for me, when I need something a little bit more complicated than Figma or Canva. I seldom use this tool these days, but it is an excellent to keep in the backpocket if needed.

### [Bootstrap.build](https://bootstrap.build/)
Sometimes I use Bootstrap (or I did quite a bit before Tailwind) and customising the look of the Boostrap components to be unique is made extremely easy with this utility. I have used this quite a few times to achieve a custom look, most recently though I have transitioned to using Tailwind and I am much happier. There is also quite a decent community that is up and coming as Tailwind continues to grow.

# <a name="Dev"></a>Developing

### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
I can't say much here that is new - VSCode is a code editor that is highly extensible and provides the flexibility to customise a development environment to exactly how you like. Small points to Atom, I which I used to use - but VSCodes extensions system is just soo good (I still use Atom one dark theme though ‚ô•)

### [Powertoys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)
Yes, I admit it. I develop pretty much exlusively on Windows, only touching Linux when setting up a server or completing a deployment. Linux as dekstop environment would be much more customisble, but between being stuck on Windows for work and laziness - I am on Windows. Here's where Powertoys comes into play, this small Microsoft developed utility provides some excellent features for Windows. Included is a color picker, file explorer improvements, image resizer, a fantastic search box, fancy zones plus more. 

One of the best utilities included is fancy zones which manages to provide the functionality that TWM have on Linux. This tool alone, in my opinion, makes PowerToys solid recommendation for any Windows PC.

# <a name="Data"></a>Datascience & Python

<br>

> Sorry all other langauges, for me DS is purely üêç

Things listed here are probably Python packages that are super duper helpful 

### [Pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)
Once you use this package - you will not go without it. Making use of the defacto Pandas dataframe, the pandas-profiling package generates a comprehensive exploratory data analysis web page. Think of .describe() but on super saiyan level steroids and made visual - it is truly awesome and can save quite a bit of time.

### [schedule](https://pypi.org/project/schedule/)
Yes, cron exists, but schedule is an absolutely beautiful implementation for scheduling Python functions. The syntax is 100% human-friendly and makes completing periodic jobs an extremely straight forward process. I've personally used this for data scraping and updating database entries on a round-the-clock basis. 

### [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
Prediction: Streamlit will be big in 2021 - this has to be the best interactive data explorer/app generation package created for Python. Streamlit allows the creation of functional web apps in only a few lines of Python code - creating an interactive interface for a ML/AI model has never been easier. Streamlit applications can be prototyped very quickly, but can be deployed with equal amount of effort. If a client requires some simple web interface for completing a task, a streamlit implementation should be the first consideration - development time has never been quicker ‚ö°‚ö°
