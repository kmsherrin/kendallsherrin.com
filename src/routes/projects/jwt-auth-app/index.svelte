        <h1>Project Intro</h1>

        <p>
            I used this short project as a chance to check out how JSON Web Tokens can be implemented for 
            authentication purposes. The basis of the project is the stock standard Svelte/Sapper template 
            providing a basic framework and routing. I also set this project up as a SSR project - which has some
            implications for the JWT usage.
        </p>

        <p>
            The end goal for this project was to have a production-ready authentication 
            microservice (plus minus a little bit extra) backend that when pinged would provide a 
            means for creating and verifying JWTs.
        </p>

        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>
            In the pursuit of learning more about modern web application development and the need for 
            decentralised techniques I need to learn about implementing JSON web tokens. The benefit of
            JWTs is that they are completely self contained - removing the need for a central truth database 
            used to store user sessions in a typical multi-processed monolith structure. JWTs allow an array
            of microservices to all independently verify a users session. This has huge implications for creating
            extremely scalable web applications.

        <h1>Project Overview</h1>

        For this project I did minimal work on the frontend, it was more a case of 
        doing just enough to produce a MVP.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Backend: Express server
            </li>
            <li>
                Database: MongoDB (interfaced with ORM Mongoose)
            </li>
            <li>
                Frontend: Svelte and Sapper, no CSS library
            </li>
            
        </ul>

        <p> 
            Managing state with Svelte and Sapper is incredibly easy, instead of
            relying on complicated state-management packages like other Javascript 
            frameworks, Svelte and Sapper make it incredibly straightforward. It 
            is quite enjoyable in comparison.

        <h1>Deployment</h1>

        <p>
            If you've read my other project posts, you might see a trend. Heroku's deploy from 
            Github functionality is soo good that I can't stop using it. Which is exactly what I've done for this 
            project. It was slightly different as I had to build the SSR app first then deploy the 
            result - but still very much straight forward.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-6xl">Future Improvements</h1>
        <p>
            Future improvements for this project could be quite a long list - but really wouldn't meet the
            aim of this project. Pertaining to the use of the JWT, I am sure there is slight improvements that 
            I could make, such as including state information within the token, including a better refresh token 
            mechanism and also considering a logout on all devices functionality (blacklist database). 
            
            I think for future projects, JWT will be a go-to for me.

            I will write more here if I can get the time to, I would like to put some code snips in (K.S 25-01-21)
