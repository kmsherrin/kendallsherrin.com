            I've still yet to write this. The project was quite large and I would like to clean the code for presentation. 

            The project involved the scraping and collection of data from websites and public APIs. Data was collated into multiple databases, 
            scraped around the clock with a Raspberry Pi. This data was fed through a multistep pipeline to generate the greyhound racing
            predictions from track/distance specific machine learning models. 
            <br>
            
            A Django website was implemented to serve the data in a web app which people could access to see upcoming predictions. The
            web app was also configured with NGINX to be served from the Raspberry Pi.
